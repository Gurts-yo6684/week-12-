# Objective:
# Students will manipulate nested lists and understand basic list comprehensions.

# vegstables = ["celery", "carrots", "potatoes"],
# meats = ["chicken", "fish", "banana"] 


# groceries = [fruits, vegstables, meats] # This means that fruits is  vegstables is number 2 and meats is number 2

# print(groceries[0][0]) 
# print(groceries[2][0])

# groceriess = [ ["apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"],
#              ["celery", "carrots", "potatoes"],
#              ["chicken", "fish", "banana"] ]


# for collection in groceriess: 
#     for food in collection:

# Key Notes:

# A list can contain other lists.

# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

# Key Notes:

# A list can contain other lists.

# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

# Examples:

# matrix = [
#     [1, 2, 3],
#     [4, 5, 6],
#     [7, 8, 9]
# ]

# print(matrix[1][2])    # 6

# # List comprehension
# first_col = [row[0] for row in matrix]
# print(first_col)       # [1, 4, 7]



# Practice Problems:

# Build a matrix variable containing 3 lists of 3 numbers each.

colors = [["red", "orange", "yellow"],
        ["green", "blue", "purple"],
        ["pink", "black", "white"]]

# Print the first list.
print(colors[0])
# Print the second item from the third list.
print(colors[2][1])
# Use a list comprehension to extract the last item from each sub-list.
final = [row[-1] for row in colors]
print(final)
# Challenge: Create a new list containing squares of numbers from 1–10 using a comprehension.

squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]
for x in range(1, 11):
    print(x**2)
